# Wasteland Feeder — shareable topology.
#
# Bridges the Wasteland federation wanted board with a city's worker pool.
# An exec automation polls Wasteland for open items, claims them, and creates
# beads labeled for the target worker pool. No agent required — the controller
# runs the script directly.
#
# Usage in city.toml:
#   [workspace]
#   topologies = ["topologies/wasteland-feeder"]
#
# Required env vars (set before `gc start`):
#   WL_BIN          — path to the `wl` CLI (default: "wl")
#   WL_TARGET_POOL  — pool label for created beads (default: "polecat")
#
# Optional env vars:
#   WL_PROJECT      — filter wanted board by project (empty = all)
#   WL_PROJECT_MAP  — comma-separated project=rig routing map
