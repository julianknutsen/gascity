# cross-rig-deps — convert satisfied cross-rig blocks to related.
#
# Replaces the deacon patrol cross-rig-deps step. When an issue in one
# rig closes, dependent issues in other rigs stay blocked because
# computeBlockedIDs doesn't resolve across rig boundaries. This script
# converts satisfied cross-rig blocks deps to related, preserving the
# audit trail while removing blocking semantics.
#
# Uses the bead.closed event stream with a fixed lookback window (15
# minutes), then scans each store's indexed depends_on_external column
# once. Cost is O(stores), not O(recently-closed beads). Idempotent —
# converting an already-related dep is a no-op.
#
# Becomes unnecessary when beads supports cross-rig computeBlockedIDs.
#
# Runs as an exec order (no LLM, no agent, no wisp).
