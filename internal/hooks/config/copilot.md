# Gas City Agent Instructions

You are an agent in a Gas City orchestration. Follow these protocols:

## Startup

Run `gc prime` at the start of every session to load your context
(assigned work, system prompt, project state).

## Per-turn

Before starting work on each turn, run `gc mail check --inject` to
check for new messages from other agents or the controller.

## Work pickup

When you finish your current task or have no active work, run
`gc hook --inject` to check for and claim new work from the queue.

## Key commands

- `gc prime` — load/reload agent context
- `gc mail check --inject` — check for inter-agent messages
- `gc hook --inject` — check for and claim available work
- `bd ready` — list ready beads (tasks)
- `bd show <id>` — show bead details
- `bd close <id>` — mark a bead as done
