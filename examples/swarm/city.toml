# Swarm — flat peer topology with shared-directory rigs.
#
# A mayor coordinates, a deacon patrols health, dogs handle infrastructure.
# Per-rig: N coders self-organize via beads and mail, a dedicated committer
# handles git. No worktree isolation — all rig agents share one directory.
#
# Contrast with Gas Town (examples/gastown/): fewer rig roles (2 vs 4),
# no formulas, no worktree isolation, flat peer coordination instead of
# hierarchical dispatch.
#
# To use: gc start examples/swarm/
# Requires rigs to be registered: gc rig add <path>
