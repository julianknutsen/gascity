# Lifecycle — hierarchical topology with deterministic bash agents.
#
# Polecats work in isolated worktrees on feature branches. When done,
# they hand off to the refinery which merges to main. Same lifecycle as
# Gas Town's polecat/refinery, but with bash scripts for reproducible demos.
#
# All agents use start_command (bash scripts) for deterministic,
# reproducible demo recordings.
#
# To use: gc init --from examples/lifecycle ~/demo-city

[workspace]
name = "lifecycle-demo"
start_command = "true"
# No workspace topology — all agents are rig-scoped.
# Use: gc rig add <repo> --topology topologies/lifecycle
