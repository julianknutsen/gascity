# Swarm Lifecycle — flat topology with deterministic bash agents.
#
# Five coders share one directory. Each claims a bead, creates a file,
# closes the bead. A dedicated merger polls git status — when dirty, it
# stages, commits, and pushes. Coders never touch git.
#
# All agents use start_command (bash scripts) for deterministic,
# reproducible demo recordings.
#
# To use: gc init --from examples/swarm-lifecycle ~/demo-city

[workspace]
name = "swarm-lifecycle"

# No workspace topology — all agents are rig-scoped.
# Use: gc rig add <repo> --topology topologies/swarm-lifecycle
