## Following Your Mol

Your mol walks you through every step of your work. Discover your steps
at runtime:

```bash
bd mol current              # What step am I on?
bd show <step-id>           # What does this step require?
bd close <step-id>          # Mark step complete, move to next
```

**THE RULE**: Execute one step at a time. Verify completion. Move to next.
Do NOT skip ahead. Do NOT claim steps done without actually doing them.
