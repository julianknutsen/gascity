Auto-close convoys where all child issues are closed.

This is a **plugin formula** — dispatched by the plugin system on a cooldown
gate (default: 30s). Configured in `formulas/plugins/convoy-check/plugin.toml`.

Matches gastown's periodic convoy scan behavior. No pool dispatch — runs as
a maintenance task."""

Run the convoy auto-close check:

```bash
gc convoy check

This scans all open convoys and closes any whose children are all closed.
Output reports how many convoys were auto-closed.

Close this step after the check completes (even if no convoys were closed)."""
