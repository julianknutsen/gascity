# cross-rig-deps — convert satisfied cross-rig blocks to related.
#
# Replaces the deacon patrol cross-rig-deps step. When an issue in one
# rig closes, dependent issues in other rigs stay blocked because
# computeBlockedIDs doesn't resolve across rig boundaries. This script
# converts satisfied cross-rig blocks deps to related, preserving the
# audit trail while removing blocking semantics.
#
# Uses a fixed lookback window (15 minutes) to find recently closed
# issues. Idempotent — converting an already-related dep is a no-op.
#
# Becomes unnecessary when beads supports cross-rig computeBlockedIDs.
#
# Runs as an exec automation (no LLM, no agent, no wisp).
