# Replaces deacon patrol step: cross-rig-deps
#
# When an issue in one rig closes, dependent issues in other rigs stay
# blocked because computeBlockedIDs doesn't resolve across rig boundaries.
# This automation converts satisfied cross-rig blocks deps to related,
# preserving the audit trail while removing blocking semantics.
#
# Becomes unnecessary when beads supports cross-rig computeBlockedIDs.
