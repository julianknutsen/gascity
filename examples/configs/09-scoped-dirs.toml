# Tutorial 09 — Scoped Directories
#
# Agents stepping on each other's files? Give them their own workspace.
# The `dir` field sets each agent's working directory. Relative paths
# resolve from the city root. Missing directories are created on start.
# Each agent gets GC_DIR in its environment so prompts can reference it.
