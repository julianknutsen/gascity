# Tutorial 10: Rigs — Isolated Per-Project Beads
#
# Each rig gets its own .beads/ database with a unique prefix for bead IDs,
# plus a routes.jsonl that enables cross-rig bead references.
#
# Prefixes are derived from the rig name if not specified:
#   "frontend" → "fr", "my-backend" → "mb", "tower-of-hanoi" → "toh"
