# Dispatch (Sling)

> Last verified against code: 2026-03-01

## Summary

Dispatch is Gas City's work routing mechanism -- a Layer 2-4 derived
mechanism that composes primitives (Agent Protocol, Bead Store, Event Bus,
Config) to route work to agents. The `gc sling` command resolves a target
agent or pool, optionally instantiates a formula as a wisp, executes the
agent's sling query to route each bead, optionally wraps single beads in
a tracking convoy, records telemetry, and nudges the target. Container
beads (convoy, epic) are expanded to their open children before routing.

## Key Concepts

- **Sling**: The act of routing a bead to an agent or pool by executing
  the target's sling query. The sling query is a shell command template
  with `{}` as a placeholder for the bead ID. Implemented in
  `cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`.

- **Sling Query**: A shell command template on each agent config
  (`sling_query`) that routes a bead to that agent. Defaults to
  `bd update {} --assignee=<qualified-name>` for fixed agents and
  `bd update {} --label=pool:<qualified-name>` for pool agents. The `{}`
  placeholder is replaced with the actual bead ID at dispatch time.
  Defined in `internal/config/config.go:EffectiveSlingQuery`.

- **Container Expansion**: When a container bead (convoy or epic) is
  slung, dispatch expands it to its open children and routes each child
  individually. Non-open children are skipped. The container itself
  becomes the convoy -- no auto-convoy is created.

- **Auto-Convoy**: When slinging a single bead (not a formula, not a
  container), dispatch automatically wraps it in a new convoy bead for
  batch tracking. Suppressed with `--no-convoy`.

- **Wisp Instantiation**: When `--formula` is set, dispatch creates an
  ephemeral molecule (wisp) from the named formula via `Store.MolCook`
  and routes the wisp's root bead to the target. Variable substitution
  and custom titles are supported.

- **Target Resolution**: The 2-step resolution of agent names -- first
  literal match against qualified names, then contextual match using the
  current rig directory. Implemented in
  `cmd/gc/cmd_agent.go:resolveAgentIdentity`.

- **System Formula**: A formula embedded in the `gc` binary that is
  materialized to `.gc/system-formulas/` at startup. System formulas
  are always overwritten to stay in sync with the binary version. Stale
  files are cleaned up. Implemented in `cmd/gc/system_formulas.go`.

## Architecture

Dispatch is not a separate Go package. It is a composition of primitives
orchestrated by `cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`. The dispatch pipeline has three
layers:

```
CLI layer (cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go)
  |
  +-- cmdSling()          resolve city, config, agent, store
  |     |
  |     v
  +-- doSlingBatch()      container expansion (convoy/epic -> children)
        |
        +-- doSling()     single-bead dispatch pipeline:
              |
              +-- instantiateWisp()     [if --formula] MolCook
              +-- checkBeadState()      [pre-flight] warn re-route
              +-- buildSlingCommand()   {} -> bead ID substitution
              +-- runner(slingCmd)      execute shell command
              +-- telemetry.RecordSling()
              +-- store.SetMetadata()   [if --merge] merge strategy
              +-- store.Create(convoy)  [if auto-convoy] tracking wrapper
              +-- doSlingNudge()        [if --nudge] wake the agent
```

### Data Flow

**Single bead dispatch** (`gc sling <agent> <bead-id>`):

1. `cmdSling` resolves the city path, loads config, and resolves the
   target agent via `resolveAgentIdentity`.
2. `doSlingBatch` checks if the bead is a container type. If not, falls
   through to `doSling`.
3. `doSling` warns about suspended agents or empty pools (unless
   `--force`).
4. If `--formula`, calls `instantiateWisp` which delegates to
   `Store.MolCook` to create the wisp and uses the root bead ID.
5. Pre-flight: warns if the bead already has an assignee or pool labels
   (unless `--force`).
6. Builds the sling command by replacing `{}` in the agent's
   `EffectiveSlingQuery()` with the bead ID.
7. Executes the sling command via `SlingRunner` (shell `sh -c`).
8. Records telemetry via `telemetry.RecordSling`.
9. If `--merge` is set, writes the merge strategy as bead metadata.
10. If auto-convoy is enabled (not `--no-convoy`, not `--formula`),
    creates a convoy bead and sets the routed bead's ParentID to the
    convoy.
11. If `--nudge`, sends a nudge to the target agent.

**Container expansion** (`gc sling <agent> <convoy-id>`):

1. `doSlingBatch` looks up the bead and checks `IsContainerType`.
2. Lists all children via `querier.Children`.
3. Partitions children into open (routable) and skipped (non-open).
4. Routes each open child individually through `buildSlingCommand` +
   `runner`. No auto-convoy is created -- the container IS the convoy.
5. Reports per-child success/failure and a summary line.
6. Nudges once after all children are routed (if `--nudge` and at
   least one succeeded).

### Key Types

- **`SlingOpts`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- All flags for the sling
  command: `IsFormula`, `DoNudge`, `Force`, `Title`, `Vars`, `Merge`,
  `NoConvoy`, `Owned`.

- **`SlingRunner`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- Function type
  `func(command string) (string, error)` that executes the sling shell
  command. Injectable for testing.

- **`BeadQuerier`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- Interface for retrieving
  a single bead by ID. Used for pre-flight checks.

- **`BeadChildQuerier`** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling.go`) -- Extends `BeadQuerier`
  with `Children(parentID)` for container expansion.

- **`config.Agent`** (`internal/config/config.go`) -- Carries the
  `SlingQuery` field and `EffectiveSlingQuery()` method that determines
  how beads are routed to this agent.

## Invariants

1. **Sling query placeholder is always `{}`.** The `buildSlingCommand`
   function performs literal string replacement of all `{}` occurrences
   with the bead ID. No other placeholder syntax is supported.

2. **Container expansion routes only open children.** Children with
   status other than `"open"` are skipped and reported, never routed.

3. **Auto-convoy is suppressed for formulas and containers.** When
   `--formula` is set or the target bead is a container type, no
   auto-convoy is created. Formulas have their own molecule structure;
   containers are their own convoy.

4. **`--owned` requires a convoy.** The `--owned` and `--no-convoy`
   flags are mutually exclusive. The CLI rejects the combination before
   dispatch begins.

5. **Merge strategy is one of three values.** `--merge` accepts only
   `"direct"`, `"mr"`, or `"local"`. The CLI validates before dispatch.

6. **Pre-flight warnings are best-effort.** If the bead store query
   fails, dispatch proceeds silently. Warnings never block routing.

7. **Telemetry records every dispatch attempt.** `RecordSling` is called
   on both success and failure paths with the target name, target type
   (`"agent"` or `"pool"`), method (`"bead"`, `"formula"`, or `"batch"`),
   and error status.

8. **Pool nudge targets the first running instance.** When nudging a
   pool, dispatch iterates pool instances in order and nudges the first
   one with a running session. If none are running, a warning is emitted.

9. **System formulas are idempotent.** `MaterializeSystemFormulas`
   always overwrites files to match the binary version and removes stale
   formula files that are no longer embedded. Non-formula files in the
   directory are left alone.

10. **Default sling queries differ by agent type.** Fixed agents default
    to `bd update {} --assignee=<name>`; pool agents default to
    `bd update {} --label=pool:<name>`. Custom `sling_query` overrides
    the default entirely.

## Interactions

| Depends on | How |
|---|---|
| `internal/beads` (Store) | `MolCook` for wisp instantiation, `Create` for auto-convoy, `Get`/`Children` for container expansion, `Update` for ParentID linking, `SetMetadata` for merge strategy |
| `internal/config` | Agent resolution, `EffectiveSlingQuery`, pool detection via `IsPool`, `PoolConfig` for sizing, `Suspended` flag |
| `internal/session` | `Provider.IsRunning` and `Provider.Nudge` for agent nudging via `doSlingNudge` |
| `internal/agent` | `SessionNameFor` to compute session names, `agent.New` + `Nudge` to deliver nudge text |
| `internal/telemetry` | `RecordSling` for metrics and log events on every dispatch |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_agent.go` | `resolveAgentIdentity` for 2-step target resolution (literal then contextual) |

| Depended on by | How |
|---|---|
| `cmd/gc/cmd_convoy.go` | Convoys are the batch tracking containers that dispatch creates and expands |
| `internal/automations` | Automation dispatch creates wisps and routes them through the same formula instantiation path (`Store.MolCook`) |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_handoff.go` | Work handoff between agents uses similar agent resolution and bead routing patterns |
| Controller | The controller's reconciliation loop drives pool sizing via `evaluatePool` which determines how many pool instances exist to receive slung work |

## Configuration

The dispatch mechanism is configured through agent-level fields in
`city.toml`:

```toml
[[agents]]
name = "worker"

# Custom sling query (optional -- has sensible defaults).
# {} is replaced with the bead ID at dispatch time.
sling_query = "bd update {} --assignee=worker"

# Custom work query (the read side of dispatch).
# Pool agents must set both sling_query and work_query, or neither.
work_query = "bd ready --assignee=worker --limit=1"

# Nudge text sent to wake the agent after routing.
nudge = "Work slung. Check your hook."
```

Pool agents with default queries:

```toml
[[agents]]
name = "coder"
pool = { min = 1, max = 3, check = "echo 2" }
# Default sling_query: bd update {} --label=pool:coder
# Default work_query:  bd ready --label=pool:coder --limit=1
```

System formulas are embedded in the `gc` binary and materialized to
`.gc/system-formulas/` at startup. They form the lowest-priority formula
layer (Layer 0) in the formula resolution stack. Topology and city-level
formulas override system formulas by name.

## Testing

Dispatch testing follows the philosophy in
[TESTING.md](../../TESTING.md), relying heavily on injected fakes:

**Unit tests** (`cmd/gc/cmd_sling_test.go`): All dispatch logic is tested
through `doSling` and `doSlingBatch` with injected `fakeRunner` (records
shell commands), `session.NewFake()` (fake session provider), and
`beads.NewMemStore()` (in-memory bead store). Tests cover:

- `buildSlingCommand` placeholder substitution including multiple `{}`
- Single-bead dispatch to fixed agents and pools
- Formula dispatch with `--formula` flag (wisp instantiation)
- Container expansion: convoy and epic beads expand to open children
- Merge strategy metadata (`--merge=direct`, `--merge=mr`, `--merge=local`)
- Auto-convoy creation and suppression (`--no-convoy`)
- Owned convoy labeling (`--owned`)
- Pre-flight warnings for already-assigned beads and pool-labeled beads
- Suspended agent and empty pool warnings
- Nudge delivery to fixed agents and first running pool member
- Error paths: runner failure, MolCook failure, store failure

**System formula tests** (`cmd/gc/system_formulas_test.go`): Cover
materialization from embedded FS including empty FS (no-op), file
writing, overwrite semantics, stale file cleanup, idempotency, and
automation subdirectory support.

**Config tests** (`internal/config/config_test.go`):
`TestEffectiveSlingQuery*` tests verify default sling query generation
for fixed agents, rig-scoped agents, pool agents, and custom overrides.
`TestValidatePoolWorkQueryMismatch` verifies that pool agents must set
both `sling_query` and `work_query` together or neither.

## Known Limitations

- **Sling query is a shell command, not a Go function call.** Every
  dispatch forks a shell process via `sh -c`. This is simple and
  flexible (any CLI tool can be a routing backend) but adds per-bead
  fork overhead during batch expansion of large containers.

- **Container expansion is serial.** When expanding a convoy or epic,
  each child is slung sequentially. A single slow or failing sling
  command blocks subsequent children. Partial success is reported but
  not retried.

- **No built-in load balancing across pool instances.** Sling routes to
  the pool as a whole (via label), not to a specific instance. Work
  distribution depends on the pool's work query and claim semantics
  (`bd ready --label=pool:<name> --limit=1`), which is first-come
  first-served.

- **Nudge targets only one pool instance.** After slinging to a pool,
  `--nudge` wakes the first running instance found. Other instances
  discover work on their next poll cycle.

- **No dry-run mode.** There is no way to preview what a sling command
  would do without actually executing it. The pre-flight `checkBeadState`
  only warns; it does not prevent routing.
