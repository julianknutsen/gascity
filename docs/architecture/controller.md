## Summary

The Controller is Gas City's infrastructure orchestrator -- a long-running
daemon that drives all SDK operations without requiring any user-configured
agent role to exist. It is not one of the five primitives or four derived
mechanisms; it is the process that wires them together at runtime. The
controller's main loop watches `city.toml` for changes (via fsnotify),
periodically reconciles running agents against the desired config, evaluates
pool scaling, dispatches automations, and garbage-collects expired wisps.

## Key Concepts

- **Controller Loop**: The persistent `select` loop in `controllerLoop()`
  that fires on a configurable ticker (default 30s) and on config file
  changes. Each tick runs the full reconciliation, wisp GC, and automation
  dispatch pipeline. Implemented in `cmd/gc/controller.go`.

- **Config Reload**: The debounced mechanism by which filesystem changes
  to `city.toml` and topology directories trigger a full config re-parse.
  An `atomic.Bool` dirty flag is set by fsnotify; at the top of each tick,
  if dirty is true, `tryReloadConfig()` re-parses and validates the config.
  Rejects workspace name changes (requires controller restart).

- **Graceful Shutdown**: The two-pass agent termination sequence:
  (1) send Interrupt (Ctrl-C) to all sessions, (2) wait `shutdown_timeout`,
  (3) force-kill survivors via `Stop()`. Implemented in `gracefulStopAll()`.

- **One-Shot vs Foreground**: `gc start` performs a single reconciliation
  pass and exits. `gc start --foreground` (or `gc daemon run`) enters the
  persistent controller loop. Both share the same `buildAgents()` and
  `doReconcileAgents()` code paths.

- **Pool Evaluation**: The process of running each pool agent's `check`
  shell command, parsing the output as an integer, clamping to `[min, max]`,
  and building the corresponding agent instances. Pool checks run in
  parallel via goroutines.

- **Nil-Guard Tracker Pattern**: Optional subsystems (crash tracker, idle
  tracker, wisp GC, automation dispatcher) follow a nil-means-disabled
  convention. Callers check `if tracker != nil` before use. This avoids
  conditional plumbing and keeps the loop body clean.

## Architecture

The controller is implemented entirely in `cmd/gc/` as a set of
collaborating functions and interfaces -- not as a standalone package.
It composes primitives (Agent Protocol, Config, Event Bus, Beads, Prompts)
into the runtime orchestration loop.

### Data Flow

A complete controller lifecycle proceeds as follows:

```
gc start --foreground
  │
  ├─ 1. Auto-init city if needed
  ├─ 2. Fetch remote topologies
  ├─ 3. LoadWithIncludes(city.toml)  →  *config.City + Provenance
  ├─ 4. ensureBeadsProvider()        →  start dolt server if bd backend
  ├─ 5. ValidateRigs() + resolve paths
  ├─ 6. initAllRigBeads()           →  per-rig .beads/ databases + routes
  ├─ 7. MaterializeSystemFormulas()  →  embed system formulas as Layer 0
  ├─ 8. ResolveFormulas()            →  symlinks in .beads/formulas/
  ├─ 9. ValidateAgents() + hooks
  ├─10. newSessionProvider()         →  tmux / exec / k8s / subprocess
  ├─11. runController()
  │     ├─ acquireControllerLock()   →  flock LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB
  │     ├─ write daemon.pid
  │     ├─ startControllerSocket()   →  Unix socket for IPC
  │     ├─ build trackers (crash, idle, wisp GC, automation)
  │     └─ controllerLoop()
  │           ├─ watchConfigDirs()   →  fsnotify on config + topology dirs
  │           ├─ initial reconciliation
  │           └─ ticker loop:
  │                 ├─ if dirty: tryReloadConfig() + rebuild trackers
  │                 ├─ buildAgents(cfg)  →  evaluate pools in parallel
  │                 ├─ doReconcileAgents()
  │                 ├─ wispGC.runGC()
  │                 └─ automationDispatcher.dispatch()
  │
  └─ shutdown:
        ├─ gracefulStopAll()         →  interrupt → wait → kill
        ├─ record controller.stopped event
        └─ release lock + remove socket + pid
```

### Main Loop Detail

Each tick of `controllerLoop()` (`cmd/gc/controller.go:268-320`) performs:

1. **Dirty check** (`dirty.Swap(false)`): If config files changed since
   the last tick, `tryReloadConfig()` re-parses `city.toml` with includes
   and patches. On success, all four trackers are rebuilt from the new
   config. On failure (parse error, validation error, name change), the
   old config is kept and an error is logged.

2. **Agent list build** (`buildAgents(cfg)`): Re-evaluates the desired
   agent set. For pool agents, `evaluatePool()` runs `check` commands in
   parallel via goroutines (`cmd/gc/pool.go:43`). Suspended agents and
   agents in suspended rigs are excluded. Fixed agents are resolved
   individually. Each agent gets its environment, prompt, hooks, overlay,
   and session setup expanded.

3. **Reconciliation** (`doReconcileAgents()`): Declarative convergence --
   make running sessions match the desired list. See
   [Health Patrol](health-patrol.md) for the reconciliation state machine,
   crash loop quarantine, and idle tracking details.

4. **Wisp GC** (`wg.runGC()`): If enabled (`wisp_gc_interval` and
   `wisp_ttl` both set), queries closed molecules via `bd list` and
   deletes those older than the TTL cutoff.

5. **Automation dispatch** (`ad.dispatch()`): Evaluates gate conditions
   for all non-manual automations. See
   [Health Patrol](health-patrol.md) for gate evaluation and dispatch
   details.

### Key Types

- **`controllerLoop()`** (`cmd/gc/controller.go:226`): The main loop
  function. Accepts all dependencies as parameters for testability:
  config, build function, session provider, reconcile/drain ops, all four
  trackers, event recorder, and I/O writers.

- **`runController()`** (`cmd/gc/controller.go:335`): The top-level
  orchestrator. Acquires the flock, opens the Unix socket, builds
  trackers, enters the loop, and performs graceful shutdown on exit.

- **`tryReloadConfig()`** (`cmd/gc/controller.go:137`): Config reload
  with validation. Rejects workspace name changes. Returns the new
  config, provenance, and revision hash on success.

- **`gracefulStopAll()`** (`cmd/gc/controller.go:169`): Two-pass shutdown.
  Interrupt all sessions, wait `shutdown_timeout`, then force-kill
  survivors.

- **`DaemonConfig`** (`internal/config/config.go:377`): Configuration
  struct holding `patrol_interval`, `max_restarts`, `restart_window`,
  `shutdown_timeout`, `wisp_gc_interval`, `wisp_ttl`. All durations
  have `*Duration()` accessor methods with sensible defaults.

## Invariants

These properties must hold for the controller to be correct. Violations
indicate bugs.

- **Single controller per city**: At most one controller runs per city
  directory. Enforced by `flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` on
  `.gc/controller.lock`. A second `gc start --foreground` fails
  immediately with "controller already running."

- **Config reload preserves city identity**: `tryReloadConfig()` rejects
  any reload where `workspace.name` changes. The city name is locked at
  startup; changing it requires a controller restart.

- **Tracker rebuild is atomic per tick**: When config reloads, all four
  trackers (crash, idle, wisp GC, automation) are rebuilt in the same tick
  before reconciliation runs. No tick ever uses a mix of old and new
  tracker state.

- **Dirty flag is edge-triggered, not level-triggered**: The `atomic.Bool`
  is set by the fsnotify goroutine and cleared by `dirty.Swap(false)` at
  the top of each tick. Multiple filesystem events within a single tick
  coalesce into a single reload.

- **Pool check commands run in parallel**: `evaluatePool()` calls for all
  pool agents in a single `buildAgents()` invocation run concurrently via
  goroutines. Results are processed sequentially after `wg.Wait()`.

- **One-shot and foreground share the same reconciliation code**:
  `doReconcileAgents()` is called identically by both the one-shot path
  (`gc start`) and the controller loop (`gc start --foreground`). The only
  difference is that one-shot passes nil for drain ops, crash tracker, and
  idle tracker.

- **Graceful shutdown sends Interrupt before Stop**: `gracefulStopAll()`
  always sends `Interrupt()` to all sessions before sleeping
  `shutdown_timeout` and calling `Stop()` on survivors. Zero timeout
  skips the grace period entirely.

- **Socket cleanup is best-effort**: The Unix socket at
  `.gc/controller.sock` is removed on startup (stale cleanup) and on
  shutdown. Crash-orphaned sockets are cleaned up by the next controller
  start.

- **No role names in Go code**: The controller operates on `agent.Agent`
  values constructed from config. No line of Go references a specific
  role name.

- **SDK self-sufficiency**: All controller operations (config watch,
  reconciliation, pool scaling, automation dispatch, wisp GC, graceful
  shutdown) function with only the controller process running. No user-
  configured agent role is required for any infrastructure operation.

## Interactions

| Depends on | How |
|---|---|
| `internal/config` | `LoadWithIncludes()` for config parsing, `DaemonConfig` for loop timing, `Revision()` for reload detection, `WatchDirs()` for fsnotify targets, `ValidateAgents()`/`ValidateRigs()` for validation, `ResolveProvider()` for agent commands. |
| `internal/session` | `Provider` interface for Start/Stop/IsRunning/ListRunning/Interrupt/Peek/SetMeta/GetMeta/ClearScrollback. `ConfigFingerprint()` for drift detection. Provider implementations: tmux, exec, subprocess, k8s, fake. |
| `internal/agent` | `Agent` interface wrapping config + session provider. `New()` constructs instances. `SessionNameFor()` computes session names. |
| `internal/events` | `Recorder` for emitting lifecycle events. `Provider` for event gate queries in automation dispatch. `NewFileRecorder()` for JSONL persistence. |
| `internal/beads` | `Store` for automation tracking beads. `CommandRunner` for bd CLI invocation. `NewBdStore()` for rig-scoped stores. |
| `internal/automations` | `Scan()` for automation discovery. `CheckGate()` for gate evaluation. |
| `internal/hooks` | `Install()` for provider-specific agent hooks. `Validate()` for hook name validation. |
| `internal/dolt` | `EnsureRunning()` / `StopCity()` / `InitRigBeads()` for dolt server lifecycle. |
| `internal/fsys` | `OSFS{}` filesystem abstraction for testability. |
| `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` | File system watcher for config directory change detection. |

| Depended on by | How |
|---|---|
| `cmd/gc/cmd_start.go` | Entry point: `doStart()` calls `runController()` in foreground mode. |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_daemon.go` | `doDaemonRun()` delegates to `doStart()` with log file teeing. `doDaemonStart()` forks a background `gc daemon run` child. |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_stop.go` | `tryStopController()` connects to the Unix socket and sends "stop". |

## Configuration

The controller is configured via the `[daemon]` section of `city.toml`:

```toml
[daemon]
patrol_interval = "30s"     # reconciliation tick frequency (default: 30s)
max_restarts = 5            # crash loop threshold (default: 5, 0 = unlimited)
restart_window = "1h"       # sliding window for restart counting (default: 1h)
shutdown_timeout = "5s"     # grace period before force-kill (default: 5s)
wisp_gc_interval = "5m"     # wisp GC run frequency (disabled if unset)
wisp_ttl = "24h"            # how long closed wisps survive (disabled if unset)
```

Session provider selection (affects all controller session operations):

```toml
[session]
provider = ""               # "", "fake", "fail", "subprocess", "exec:<script>", "k8s"
```

Beads provider selection (affects automation tracking, wisp GC):

```toml
[beads]
provider = "bd"             # "bd" (default), "file", "exec:<script>"
```

Automation filtering:

```toml
[automations]
skip = ["noisy-automation"] # automations to exclude from dispatch
max_timeout = "120s"        # hard cap on per-automation timeout
```

City-level suspension:

```toml
[workspace]
suspended = false           # when true, no agents are started
```

## Testing

Controller tests use in-memory fakes and require no external infrastructure:

| Test file | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `cmd/gc/controller_test.go` | Controller loop tick behavior, config reload, dirty flag, fsnotify debounce, tracker rebuild on reload, automation dispatch integration |
| `cmd/gc/reconcile_test.go` | All reconciliation states, parallel starts, zombie capture, crash quarantine integration, idle restart, pool drain, suspended agent handling, orphan cleanup |
| `cmd/gc/pool_test.go` | `evaluatePool()` (clamping, error handling), `poolAgents()` (naming, deep-copy), `expandSessionSetup()`, `expandDirTemplate()` |
| `cmd/gc/formula_resolve_test.go` | Layer priority, symlink creation/update/cleanup, idempotence, real file preservation |
| `cmd/gc/wisp_gc_test.go` | TTL-based purging, `shouldRun()` interval, empty list handling |
| `cmd/gc/automation_dispatch_test.go` | Gate evaluation, exec dispatch, wisp dispatch, tracking bead lifecycle, timeout capping, rig-scoped automations |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_daemon_test.go` | Daemon run/start/stop/status, PID file lifecycle, service file generation |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_start_test.go` | One-shot start, foreground mode, auto-init, provider resolution |
| `cmd/gc/cmd_suspend_test.go` | Suspend/resume TOML mutation, inheritance hierarchy |
| `cmd/gc/beads_provider_lifecycle_test.go` | Provider ensure/shutdown/init lifecycle |

All tests use `session.NewFake()`, `events.Discard`, and stubbed
`ExecRunner`/`CommandRunner` functions. See `TESTING.md` for the overall
testing philosophy and tier boundaries.

## Known Limitations

- **No hot-reload for structural changes**: Changing `workspace.name`
  requires a full controller restart. `tryReloadConfig()` rejects name
  changes and keeps the old config.

- **Debounce window is global**: The 200ms fsnotify debounce applies to
  all watched directories. A burst of changes across multiple topology
  dirs produces a single reload, which is correct but may delay detection
  of a single file change by up to 200ms.

- **Pool check commands can stall the tick**: Although pool checks run in
  parallel with each other, the controller tick blocks on `wg.Wait()`
  until all checks complete. A hung `check` command blocks the entire
  reconciliation cycle. There is no per-check timeout.

- **PID file is for discovery, not liveness**: The `daemon.pid` file is
  written for `gc daemon status` to find the controller process. It is
  never used for liveness decisions -- `flock` on `controller.lock` is
  the single-instance mechanism, and agent liveness uses
  `session.Provider.IsRunning()`.

- **Unix socket has no authentication**: Any local process with filesystem
  access to `.gc/controller.sock` can send "stop" to shut down the
  controller. File permissions (0o755 on `.gc/`) provide the only access
  control.

- **Tracker state is in-memory only**: Crash tracker history, idle
  tracker timestamps, and automation dispatch state are all lost on
  controller restart. This is intentional (matches Erlang/OTP supervisor
  restart semantics) but may surprise operators expecting persistence
  across restarts.
